------------------- Task Description --------------------
The First Task:
In this part, we familiarized ourselves with using vmware to open Minix 3. Our objective goal in this task
is to find the source file in the Minix source code that prints the copyright message upon boot and
add an extra print command to follow that copyright message. The copyright message that is printed is
actually part of what is called the “MINIX startup banner”. To Locate the file, we can use command line
tool "Grep"

The Two-Week Assignment:
Our goal of this assignment is to gain experience in modifying an operating system kernel,
and specifically the process scheduling algorithm. Using the Minix 3 operating system,
running under vmware, we modified the queue selection algorithm to skew and randomize the priority scheduling.
